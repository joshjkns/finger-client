i mean it works but there is like no more finger servers that use basic finger, they all use the finger cli thing which i think is just http on port 80 so my client wouldn't work for that i don't think?

edit:
can just use my file as a http client instead and use port 80 for plan.cats ip 45.20.163.42 to get a response! accidentally made a http client

rip finger on port 79
