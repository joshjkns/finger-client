client.c and server.c are just websocket examples that could work with any sort of communication, such as finger (although they are on port 8080 or 8000 rather than 79)

client-finger.c actually works! port 79 and using plan.cat's ip to get my user /~bet.
client-http.c is just a http client that also gets my user from plan.cat, but its not finger, thought this was all you could do anymore but I was just being stupid with the message in client-finger.c
